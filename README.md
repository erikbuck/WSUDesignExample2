# WSUDesignExample

This repository contains an in-class example of software design for Wright State University CEG-4110, "Intro. Software Eng." The example uses an iterative approach and identifies expected design artifacts.

There is a Requirements document in the *documents* directory. Run Doxygen to generate formatted documentation that includes design information and traceability of both design and implementation to requirements.

This project has an unusual structure for Xcode projects because it is inspired by/derived from [a sample project that integrates Google Test for C++ testing] (https://github.com/mattstevens/xcode-googletest).
